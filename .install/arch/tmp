Please note the following requirements for AWS VPN Client:

* If you depend on DNS servers from VPN you need to have a running
systemd-resolved.service. Please ensure it does not conflict with any
other DNS resolver service or configuration you may use.

sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service \
  && sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved.service

* You have to enable and start the awsvpnclient.service after
installation:

sudo systemctl enable awsvpnclient \
  && sudo systemctl start awsvpnclient

For troubelshooting its worth checking first the logs:
/home/$USER/.config/AWSVPNClient/ /var/log/aws-vpn-client/$USER/
