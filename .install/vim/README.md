# Vim Install
This contains instructions and script for installing and uninstalling vim plugins.


## Vim Plugins (Vim 8 or above)

By default, Vim settings are stored in ~/.vim

Vim scans all directories in ~/.vim for plugins contained in pack/\*/start

Vim recommends that each plugin project gets its own directory within ~/.vim/pack

Example for NERDTree
```
~/.vim/pack/NERDTree/start/
```
